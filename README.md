Watt & WTM
==========

Watt has been created by Benoit Pereira da Silva and is licensed under LGPL.
Watt & WTM are currently in early intensive experimental phases.

Watt is a model driven framework based extensively on code generation (Flexions)

WTM is an Hyper&Multi/Media engine based on a portable packageable  format built.
WTM is built using watt & Flexions.
You should use the Watt.xcworlspace only.

If you use the PlayerSampleFlexions you need to install Flexions (a code generator) at the same level as the root Watt folder
